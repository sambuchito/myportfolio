        <p class="more-about-text">
          QA Tester & Web Developer with experience in both manual testing and web development. Passionate about building clean, functional user experiences and ensuring software quality through detailed testing and documentation.
        </p>
        <p class="more-about-text">
          I’m currently transitioning into tech after years of working in fast-paced, people-focused roles.  
          What started with curiosity about software testing turned into a growing interest in how things are built — and how to break them (on purpose).

        <p class="more-about-text">
          I’m a hands-on learner. I like tinkering, googling things at 2 a.m., and making messy code a little cleaner each time.  
          I’m especially drawn to projects that mix logic with creativity — whether it’s coding, designing, or editing.
        </p>
        <p class="more-about-text">
          I’m now studying FullStack development at BIOS and completing a mid-term project for the Certified Tech Developer program at Digital House,  
          where I get to combine my testing background with front-end and back-end experience.
